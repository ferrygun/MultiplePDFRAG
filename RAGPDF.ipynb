       " 'Overview\\n\\nMarket sentiment about generative AI has entered a new era. Early hype is fading. Business leaders have a clearer view of its strengths and challenges.\\n\\nMajor press, such as the Wall Street Journal, The Economist, and others have wondered if the AI hype over-promised and under-delivered. But very few have considered a key value driver for companies: Business processes and operations. As legendary business thinker Tom Davenport wrote in HBR: “Most AI applications to date seek to improve a given task. But this is missing the larger picture; smart companies are viewing the introduction of AI as the rationale for a new look at end-to-end processes.”\\n\\nSeveral firms, such as McDonalds, Air Canada, and IBM have experienced high profile failures with early generative AI projects. Conventional wisdom says gen AI issues are model challenges: Ways that large language models (LLMs) need improvement. However, McKinsey notes that it is “important to recognize that the model itself makes up only 15 percent of the success [of an AI project].” There is much more to an AI strategy than training data, model weights, and prompt engineering.\\n\\nTo create consistent business value with AI, companies must also address process challenges. These include: How gen AI is activated in business processes. How AI accesses the latest data. How AI risks are governed, and how human oversight & accountability is managed.\\n\\nWith independent market research from UserEvidence, we set out to understand the impact of generative AI on business processes and operations. We surveyed 1,000+ business leaders, directors and above. Participants include every department in companies of every size.\\n\\nThe survey shows that, despite changing market sentiment:\\n\\n- Business leaders believe the hype: 82% believe genAI is the next wave of transformation in their industry.\\n- The real results are in business processes: 89% report real, measurable results from genAI in business processes.\\n- AI momentum is immune to the vibe shift: Competitors are the #1 driver. Market sentiment is only one of several drivers of AI adoption.',\n",
       " 'Top Findings\\n\\nBusiness processes = big value with AI.\\n- Over 35% have achieved revenue growth, business agility, or better decision making.\\n\\nEarly adopters are winning.\\n- Early adopters are nearly 2x more likely to report increased agility, enhanced decision making, and innovation, and 4x less likely to report no measurable results.\\n\\nAPIs & RAG drive better results.\\n- LLM approaches like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and AI activation approaches like API-first approaches have better performance.\\n\\nGovernance and human oversight matter. A lot.\\n- Governance is the #1 requirement to improve trust in AI, and 95% say human oversight is important.\\n\\nMore AI = more demand for human intelligence.\\n- Business leaders believe expert reviewers - rather than front-line or entry-level employees - should sign off on AI-generated content & decisions - meaning artificial intelligence increases demand for human intelligence.\\n\\nAPIs are the top approach to activate AI in processes.\\n- APIs are the #1 preference to activate AI in processes in the future.\\n\\nGen AI SaaS features are not a long term AI strategy.\\n- Just over 13% of business leaders believe SaaS AI features are their best AI strategy moving forward.',\n",
       " '**Chapter 1: What’s Driving AI Adoption**\\n\\n**Key Takeaways:**\\n- Many factors drive AI\\n- Pressure on departments is uneven\\n- IT is under the most pressure\\n\\nBusiness leaders hear the call to use generative AI in their processes loud and clear - 71% feel pressure to implement generative AI in their processes. The most common sources of that pressure come from outside the company. The number one source of pressure is the competition.\\n\\n**Competitors are the top driver of AI adoption.**\\n\\nWhile market sentiment on generative AI is evolving, business leaders are also responding to other sources of pressure, including competitors, external peers, analysts, internal peers, and board members.\\n\\n**Figure 1.1: What do you believe is a source of pressure (if any) to use Gen AI in your processes (select all that apply)**\\n\\n- **External Source:**\\n  - Competitors: 45%\\n  - Market Sentiment: 33%\\n  - External Peers: 31%\\n  - Analysts: 25%\\n\\n- **Internal Source:**\\n  - Internal Peers: 31%\\n  - Board Members: 39%\\n  - Internal CXOs: 21%\\n  - No Pressure at All: 16%',\n",
       " '“What happens when I have human-level intelligence, for pennies on demand, accessible 24 hours, 7 days a week, 365 days a year? How does that change all the things that we do? And then the next leap from that is, how does it change what our competitors can do? That’s when the real fire gets started. Because you start saying, ‘Gee, if I can do this, you know, the folks that I meet in the marketplace every day, who are going for those same customers, can also do this.’”\\n\\nTED SHELTON, COO, INFLECTION AI (PREVIOUSLY THE AI EXPERT PARTNER AT BAIN & COMPANY)\\n\\nThe pressure is not felt evenly across departments. It is being felt more acutely by IT, Finance, and HR, and less so by Sales, Marketing, and Operations (Figure 1.2).\\n\\nIT, Finance, and HR are under more pressure.\\n\\nFIGURE 1.2: WHICH WORD DESCRIBES THE PRESSURE YOU FEEL TO USE GENERATIVE AI IN YOUR PROCESSES?

       " '**Chapter 2: Activating LLMs in Business Processes**\\n\\n**Key Takeaways:**\\n- Foundational LLMs have an early lead\\n- SaaS features have a bleak forecast\\n- APIs are the top approach\\n\\n**Overview:**\\n\"Activating generative AI in a business process\" or \"AI-powered processes\" involves the consistent use of AI in business operations like order to cash, customer onboarding, and lead generation. This can include prompts and output steps in workflows, AI-reimagined processes, or agents executing processes autonomously.\\n\\n**Business Leaders\\' Choices:**\\n- **What** approach to take with large language models (LLMs): build from scratch, buy, or partner with a vendor.\\n- **How** to activate AI: manual prompt entry, API call, or agent.\\n- **Where** to apply it in the organization.\\n\\n**Top Approaches to LLMs:**\\n- Popularity of OpenAI\\'s ChatGPT leads business leaders to rely on industry giants.\\n- Over two-thirds (68%) use a foundational LLM like OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini, or Anthropic Claude.\\n\\n**Figure 2.1: LLM Approaches in Processes**\\n- Custom LLM\\n- Foundational LLM\\n- RAG\\n- SaaS AI Features\\n\\nPage 05',\n",
       " 'While nearly a third are building their own LLM, a majority (67%) are using foundational models with no modifications. 38% are customizing a foundational model with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).\\n\\n\"Gen AI is so successful compared to previous AI approaches because it’s easy to start with. Foundational LLMs are good enough for many things, making them easy to adopt and appealing.\"\\n— Markus Zirn, Chief Strategy Officer, Workato\\n\\nNearly every SaaS vendor became an AI vendor overnight by adding generative AI features to their products. 42% of business leaders are using a SaaS app with an AI feature (Figure 2.1). However, when asked about the future, business leaders’ opinion differs from their current strategy. Business leaders do not view SaaS features as their long-term AI strategy, with just over 13% selecting this option as their best path forward (Figure 2.2).\\n\\nOnly 13% see SaaS features as their long-term AI strategy.\\n\\n68% of companies (Figure 2.1) are using foundational models today, which are trained on the entire internet. However, this number drops by half when asked if it is the best approach in the future (Figure 2.2). This likely reflects a belief that models custom trained on domain expertise (such as customer support agent conversations, or IT helpdesk tickets) will be more effective. 35% of business leaders believe customized and specialized LLMs will offer the best path forward.\\n\\nFigure 2.2: Which strategy do you believe will be most effective for the future? (Select one)\\n\\n- Unsure: 12%\\n- SaaS Features: 14%\\n- RAG: 8%\\n- Foundational LLM: 32%\\n- Custom LLM: 15%\\n- Specialized LLM: 19%',\n",
       " 'While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is used in over 38% of use cases today, only 8% believe it is the best strategy for the future (Figure 2.3). This is unusual. RAG is used to inform AI output with the most up-to-date context. Figure 3.3 later in this report shows RAG drives better outcomes, such as enhanced decision making. It is likely that participants believe a custom or specialized LLM in the future will be able to harness the latest context without the need for RAG. Or, when forced to choose between the two, they value a customized LLM more highly even if they still plan to use RAG in the future.\\n\\nHow will AI be activated\\n\\nThere are many ways to activate generative AI in a business process. Examples might include an employee manually prompting a model such as ChatGPT, custom code interacting with the model via API, or a robotic process automation bot pasting an output into a UI text field.\\n\\n48% believe APIs are best\\n\\n13% believe SaaS features are best\\n\\n5.7% believe RPA is best\\n\\nThe data shows that the top preference of business leaders is for API-based activation of generative AI, with over 48% saying they believe the best way to activate AI is by API-driven methods, such as custom code, an integration platform, or a specialized AI orchestration tool (Figure 2.3). Later in this report, we will see that this preference is correlated with higher performance (Figure 3.4).\\n\\nFigure 2.3: In the future, which method to use generative AI in business processes do you believe will be best for your organization?\\n\\n- 29% Manual via chat\\n- 22% Other\\n- 13% SaaS AI features\\n- 6% RPA\\n- 18% Custom code via API\\n- 21% Integration/automation platform via API\\n- 9% Specialized AI orchestration via API\\n- 48% Via API',\n",
       " 'While many selected manual chat, this can either mean interacting directly with an LLM such as ChatGPT, or it can mean interacting with technology via natural language.\\n\\nNotably, the AI forecast for robotic process automation (RPA) for AI-powered processes is bleak, with only 5.7% selecting it as the best approach for activating AI in the future (Figure 2.3).\\n\\nWhere is gen AI being used in business processes\\n\\n“You can imagine dozens of use cases in HR, sales, productivity, supply chain. The list goes on and on. LLMs can make a huge difference in efficiency and productivity.”\\n\\nRAMA AKKIRAJU, VP OF AI AND ML FOR IT, NVIDIA\\n\\nProcesses in IT, customer service, operations, sales and marketing are the top early adopters of generative AI. Within the next six months, the priorities of IT and customer service shrink slightly, and HR and Finance grow, although the overall ranking remains largely the same. The pressure on HR and Finance noted in Figure 1.2 may provide some indication as to why.\\n\\nFIGURE 2.4: IN WHICH DEPARTMENTS IS GENERATIVE AI BEING USED IN PROCESSES, AND WHICH ARE PLANNED WITHIN 6 MONTHS (SELECT ALL THAT APPLY)\\n\\nConsistently (and not surprisingly) the data shows IT as the most enthusiastic early adopters of AI in business processes. CIOs are under extraordinary pressure to deliver on their organization’s AI strategy. It is also possible that IT processes represent the lowest hanging fruit, and CS, sales, and marketing bring more urgency since they are directly tied to revenue. On the other hand, Finance and HR processes may be more complex, or take longer to deliver results, leading business leaders to postpone them (Figure 2.4).\\n\\n08',\n",
       " '**Only 23% consider AI to be fully deployed in a business process**\\n\\nHowever, the maturity of the AI implementations varies. Less than a quarter of participants (23%) said AI is fully deployed in a business process. As we\\'ll see later in the report, the level of maturity has an extraordinary impact on the outcomes.\\n\\n**Figure 2.5: If generative AI is being used in your business processes, to what degree would you describe its use?**\\n\\n- Fully Deployed: 23%\\n- In Development: 42%\\n- Experimental: 24%\\n- No Use: 11%\\n\\nThe maturity of deployment varies on a department level.

But the data shows that each approach has different strategic implications (Figure 3.3).\\n\\nIf, rather than efficiency, you prioritize revenue growth, enhanced decision making, and improved agility, customizing a foundational LLM with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is the clear choice. The improvement in enhanced decision making is quite striking, in some cases 2x higher than the other choices.\\n\\nSaaS Features & Specialized LLMs are 2x more likely to report no outcomes\\n\\nRAG is nearly 2x more likely to drive enhanced decision making, agility, and revenue growth\\n\\nIf average but reliable performance is the goal, a foundational LLM alone is a strong choice.

       " 'In addition, how the LLM is activated in the business process also dictates outcomes in a significant way. In chapter 2 (Figure 2.3) we saw that business leaders have a strong preference to bring LLMs into their processes with APIs. That preference may be in part due to the performance benefits - business leaders report markedly superior outcomes across the board when using APIs, and were far less likely to report no measurable results (Figure 3.4).\\n\\nFIGURE 3.4: MEASURABLE RESULTS BY AI ACTIVATION APPROACH\\n\\nEarly adopters of AI in operations have the upper hand\\n\\nIf generative AI is going to live up to the hype, then companies that have fully deployed AI in business processes should see better results than those who are in deployment or experimenting with the technology.\\n\\nThat’s exactly what the data shows. Early adopters of AI in business processes are jumping into the lead.\\n\\nCompanies still just experimenting with AI are 4x more likely to say that they have achieved no results, whereas early adopters are nearly 2x more likely to report increased agility, enhanced decision making, faster innovation.

However - even the experimenters are gaining serious ground on the 11% of business leaders who have not yet begun using AI in their processes.\\n\\nBut generative AI is not a magic pill without side effects - in fact, as several high profile failures of generative AI projects illustrate, there is a strong need for governance and human oversight.

Without governance, LLM-powered business processes can expose sensitive data, confidently make poor decisions, and hallucinate.\\n\\nThe survey data shows that business leaders are embracing AI with eyes wide open. Trust in LLMs is mixed - when asked how reliable and consistent outputs are from generative AI, only a third (31%) rated LLMs as “very accurate.” When asked what would improve their trust in LLMs in their business processes, the number one answer was strong governance. In fact, 90+% of participants say governance is important for gen AI in their business processes.\\n\\n**Key Takeaways:**\\n- Governance is the #1 priority\\n- Data security & privacy are top concerns\\n\\n**Figure 4.1: What would improve your trust in generative AI to operate autonomously in your organization?

       " 'Is it a total rejection of autonomous AI if 95% of business leaders believe humans in the loop are important?

It is also correlated with better performance. Recent research by MIT and Accenture highlighted the benefits of nudging humans to review generative AI outputs. This form of human-AI augmentation led to measurably better performance:\\n\\n“The findings revealed that consciously adding some friction to the process of reviewing LLM-generated content can lead to increased accuracy—without significantly increasing the time required to complete the task. This has implications for how companies can deploy generative AI applications more responsibly.”\\n\\n**90% of business leaders believe AI should have a human in the loop for at least half of all processes**\\n\\n**Who should review?**\\n\\nLastly, who should be responsible for conducting this review and approval? Conversations about the “autonomous enterprise” have sparked fears that companies will operate like fast food restaurants: Automation and AI handle most of the work, and the company is staffed by entry-level employees.\\n\\nHowever, a recent article from Wharton researchers suggested a counterintuitive hypothesis: generative AI is going to increase demand for expertise, rather than decrease it: “One challenge when integrating LLM output with human oversight is that in many contexts, the human must know something about the domain to be able to assess whether the LLM output is valuable. This suggests that specific knowledge cannot be “outsourced” to an LLM—domain experts are still needed to evaluate whether LLM output is any good before it is put into use.”',\n",
       " \"The survey data reinforces this counterintuitive point - that generative AI in business processes will increase demand for human expertise. Overwhelmingly, business leaders believe that managers and subject matter experts should be tapped to review generative AI outputs and decisions, rather than front line or entry level employees (Figure 5.7).\\n\\nFigure 5.7: For most cases, what level of human oversight and review would you consider appropriate for GenAI?\\n\\n- Entry Level Employees: 4%\\n- Front Line Employees: 12%\\n- Managers: 37%\\n- Subject Matter Experts: 44%\\n- None: 3%\\n\\nMany are still getting used to the idea of reviewing human-like text generated by a machine.

       " '**Chapter 6: AI Agents & The Future of Business Processes**\\n\\nIn an article titled *Why Agents are the Next Frontier of Generative AI*, McKinsey predicts: “We are beginning an evolution from knowledge-based, gen-AI-powered tools—say, chatbots that answer questions and generate content—to gen AI-enabled “agents” that use foundation models to execute complex, multistep workflows across a digital world. In short, the technology is moving from thought to action.”\\n\\nWhether business leaders are ready or not, agentic processes are around the corner. Agentic processes are workflows that are partially or completely executed by an AI agent. Most, but not all business leaders are ready for AI agents to handle work on their behalf (Figure 6.1).\\n\\n**Figure 6.1: In the future of work, how do you feel about the ideas of AI agents completing work on your behalf?**\\n\\n- Very Uncomfortable: 13%\\n- Somewhat Uncomfortable: 20%\\n- Somewhat Comfortable: 32%\\n- Very Comfortable: 32%\\n- Unsure: 3%\\n\\nAgentic readiness varies by department.

Consider the Air Canada example that we mentioned earlier. The chat bot did not have the context it needed - so it hallucinated a refund that violated Air Canada’s own policies. And it was not empowered to take the action that it needed, so it was not able to run its decision by a human agent for approval.\\n\\nPage 25',\n",
       " 'In these early days of agentic technology, most leaders are too early in their agentic journey to report meaningful results. However, there are lessons to be learned from the results leaders are seeing by generally adding AI to their business processes. After all, these are the predecessors to the agentic future. What can they teach us?\\n\\nThe power of context\\n\\nWe can see the power of context when we look at how retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) impacts results (the charts below were originally featured in chapter 3). The RAG method allows the LLM to leverage data that would not be in its original training data, such as the latest customer data, employee data, or other. In the Air Canada example, an agent might want to access the latest refund policies, the passenger’s account data, and other available flights.\\n\\nThe value of having the latest data - which we can see in the marked performance improvement on decisioning, revenue growth, and agility - will only grow in the agentic future:\\n\\nThe Power of Context for AI Agents (Figure 3.3)\\n\\n- SaaS Features\\n- Specialized LLM\\n- Foundational LLM\\n- RAG\\n\\nGraph categories:\\n- No Measurable Results\\n- Employee Satisfaction\\n- Customer Satisfaction\\n- Faster Innovation Cycles\\n- Improved Agility\\n- Revenue Growth\\n- Enhanced Decision Making\\n- Cost Reduction\\n- Increased Efficiency\\n\\nPage 26',\n",
       " 'The ability to take action\\n\\nAs the McKinsey quote earlier in this chapter notes, agents are about AI technology “moving from thought to action.” The ability to take action across systems is paramount for agents to succeed. A sales agent would want to be able to take action across customer relationship management (CRM), a sales engagement, and sales enablement platforms.\\n\\nThe strong preference we see in today’s data for API-based usage of LLMs (Figure 2.3) and enhanced performance of LLMs in business processes for those leveraging API-based approaches (Figure 3.4) strongly suggests that agents empowered to take action across API-based connectors will outperform others.\\n\\nThe agentic gap\\n\\nEarly adopters of agentic technologies will enjoy similar benefits to the early adopters of LLMs in business processes. As we saw in chapter 3, the more mature the AI implementation, the greater the reported business value. However, the difference is that agentic technology will, as SiliconAngle reports, confer 5-10x gains in productivity upon employees. Multiplied by hundreds or thousands of employees across the company, this will undoubtedly create a major “agentic gap” between agentic and traditional companies. The agentic gap will resemble, but be far wider than the gap we see today:\\n\\nThe lesson for leaders: Ignore the agentic revolution at your peril. Despite the headlines, despite the skepticism - the evidence shows that the early adopters of generative AI in business processes are building an advantage over those who are not.',\n",
       " '**Conclusion**\\n\\nRecent reporting from the Census Bureau shows that only 4.8% of American companies use AI to produce goods and services. Many who question the hype around generative AI, including The Economist, cite this statistic. But questioning where the AI-generated products are, or why AI features aren’t driving up SaaS revenues, or other theories may be missing the point.\\n\\nAs this survey revealed - the real value, at least in these early days of generative AI innovation - is likely being felt in operations. In their business processes. Here, companies expect to gain efficiency and save costs. But the data also shows that companies are building competitive advantages - such as business agility, better decision making, and more.\\n\\nTo maximize the value of generative AI in business processes, business leaders are grappling with big strategic questions.\\n\\n- How do we activate AI in our operations?\\n- Which approach(es) do we take with LLMs?\\n- How often and when do we include humans in our AI-powered processes?\\n- What do we need to govern to make sure this innovation does not create risk?\\n\\nThe evidence is clear - despite AI doom in the press - that business leaders are driven by much more than market sentiment to explore these questions. The threat of their competitors leaping ahead in the AI arms race is enough to drive them forward. As we enter a new agentic economy, the threat of losing out on an agentic gap will only motivate them further.\\n\\nIt is up to business leaders to ensure that their organizations make the most of this disruptive moment - or risk being left behind.',\n",

All UserEvidence research is based on real user feedback without interference, bias, or spin from our clients.\\n\\nUserEvidence Research Principles\\n\\nThese principles guide all research efforts at UserEvidence—whether working with a vendor’s users for our Customer Evidence offering, or industry practitioners in a specific field for our Research Content offering. The goal of these principles is to give buyers trust and confidence that you are viewing authentic and verified research based on real user feedback, without interference, bias, and spin from the vendor.\\n\\nPrinciple 1 — Identity verification.\\n\\nIn every study we conduct, UserEvidence independently verifies that a participant in our research study is a real user of a vendor (in the case of Customer Evidence) or an industry practitioner (in the case of Research Content). We use a variety of human and algorithmic verification mechanisms, including corporate email domain verification (i.e., so a vendor can’t just create 17 Gmail addresses that all give positive reviews).\\n\\nPrinciple 2 — Significance and Representation.\\n\\nUserEvidence believes trust is built by showing an honest and complete representation of the success (or lack thereof) of users. We pursue statistical significance in our research and substantiate our findings with a large and representative set of user responses to create more confidence in our analysis. We aim to canvas a diverse swath of users across industries, seniorities, personas — to provide the whole picture of usage and allow buyers to find relevant data from other users in their segment, not just a handful of vendor-curated happy customers.\\n\\nPrinciple 3 — Quality and Independence.\\n\\nUserEvidence is committed to producing quality and independent research at all times. This starts at the beginning of the research process with survey and questionnaire design to drive accurate and substantive responses. We aim to reduce bias in our study design and use large sample sizes of respondents where possible. While UserEvidence is compensated by the vendor for conducting the research, trust is our business and our priority, and we do not allow vendors to change, influence, or misrepresent the results (even if they are unfavorable) at any time.\\n\\nPrinciple 4 — Transparency.\\n\\nWe believe research should not be done in a black box. For transparency, all UserEvidence research includes the statistical N (number of respondents), and buyers can explore the underlying blinded (de-identified) raw data and responses associated with any statistic, chart, or study. UserEvidence provides clear citation guidelines for clients when leveraging research, including guidelines on sharing research methodology and sample size.']"
